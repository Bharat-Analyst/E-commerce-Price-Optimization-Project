# E-commerce-Price-Optimization-Project
This repository features a dynamic pricing model for e-commerce. It uses historical sales data, customer insights, and market trends to optimize prices, aiming to increase sales and profit margins


# E-commerce Price Optimization

## Overview

Develop a dynamic pricing model for an online retail platform to optimize prices based on historical sales data, customer behavior, and market trends.

## Features

- Data collection and preprocessing
- Linear regression model for price optimization
- Model evaluation metrics

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/e-commerce-price-optimization.git
    cd e-commerce-price-optimization
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Load the data**: Update the data loading section in `price_optimization.py` with your actual data sources.
2. **Train the model**: Execute the script to train the linear regression model.
    ```bash
    python price_optimization.py
    ```
3. **Dynamic Pricing**: Use the provided function to calculate optimized prices for given quantities.

## Example

```python
import pandas as pd
from price_optimization import calculate_optimized_price

# Example usage of the dynamic pricing function
quantity = 5
optimized_price = calculate_optimized_price(quantity)
print(f"Optimized Price for quantity {quantity}: {optimized_price}")
